# CPlusPlusIntro
Just a short intro to C++
## Basics
Syntax is more or less the same as C except, if you want to use standard library objects, like 
the traditional input (cin) or output (cout). To relay to these objects you use the shift (>>
or <<) operator. These denote bitwise shifts. In the case of cin and cout, they denote transfer of data. 
If you would like to perform the hello world program (without the surrounding function headers), you write
```c++
std::cout<<"Hello World!"<<endl;
```
The traditional variable types should all be the same, (int, double, long, etc.). These
are used based on the type or size of data.
